<p><b> Hello World!</b></p> 
<p>This is my first blog post on <i>Here's What I Think</i> and in fact my first attempt at journaling ever. I'm looking forward to taking some time out every day to write a little bit. The idea came to when I was building this version of my website (to visit the older version visit <a href="www.apoorvagupta.com/old/">www.apoorvagupta.com/old</a>). </p>
<p>When designing the newer version, I wanted to vastly reduce the number of words I had on any page. I know that anyone besides me visiting the site wouldn't spend a bunch of time reading. They might hardly skim over it or something, but they wouldn't spend time reading paragraphs about my last internship or how l like stir fry and <i> The Wolf of Wall Street </i>. No one is going to spend time reading that stuff, because quite frankly, (almost) no one cares. Which kind of sucks, but is also important to remember. From a UX perspective, excess material on the page is a waste of space. If the CONSUMER of the content isn't finding the content useful, then it's waste, no matter how important the content may be to the author. </p>
<p>And even so, writing paragraphs about things can be unimportant but not necessarily a waste. There are things that people may want to read about me, and there things about myself that I'd want to show through on a personal website. I decided that maintaining a online journal/blog would be a good way to store that content. That way, it's out of the way of typical visitor to the site, and yet findable if someone was looking for it. To further that second part about findability, I also created a basic search service based on GVSM (Generalized Vector Space Model) to search blog posts. I'm going to try and make a journal entry each day, and I may generate quite a bit of content. The search service will index all of it, and make it decently searchable. I plan to improve on it futher since currently it doesn't consider word uniqueness in the collection. It also doesn't understand phrases and such, so there's a lot to improve.</p>
<p> So I suppose the chief purpose of the blog is to be a place where I can capture some voice, personality, and individualism, bottle it up, and display it on the web for everyone to see. There's also other benifits to keeping up a blog. As a software developer and student, I spend a lot of time coding, thinking about coding, coding, doing some math behind programs, running between meetings and classes, and coding. There's not much time to reflect on things that are going on in my life and my opinions on them. And currently I don't spend much time doing something that isn't professionally or academically focused. Simply put, I've recently found myself not investing enough time in myself.</p>
<p>I hope that taking up some journaling is going to encourage me to focus on myself and reflect on what I'm doing on a daily basis. It should be time for me to explore and write about things I'm interested in and passionate about, and in a way that I won't worry if someone doesn't find what I have to say interesting. At the same time, keeping an online blog - though it encourages more "screen time" - keeps my work on the internet and accessible everywhere, which is kinda neat. Finally, hosting it on my own website gives me the most control over the data and how it's presented and indexed.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think journaling is going to help me document some of my life. It's interesting to read, from a year or two down the line, these earlier journal entries and reflect on how one has changed as a person in that time period. It helps document the history of your day to day life, and perhaps will include lessons that may be forgotten, but should be revisited. Some of my friends at UofM have recently started documenting their lives in a "second-a-day" video. The idea is to capture about second of your life every day as video, and at the end of the year, stitch all the videos together into a 7-5 minute piece that describes your year. It's in an interesting use of modern media to capture life as we experience it in first person. After all, mobile phones with video capture technology are nearly ubiquitous now. </p>
<p>It's a highly experiential media while being easy to maintain and engage in. I know that the media I've chosen is much more work intensive, but I think I'll have higher returns cause I'm able capture more information and workable data. Perhaps when I've written several blog posts, I'll be able to perform some kind of analysis about my writing habits, my general style and whatnot. Perhaps it'll give me some interesting insights into who I am as person. And not just to me, but to anyone who cares to read. Anyway, I hope it's a good start to the dataset :D</p>
