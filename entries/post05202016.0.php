<p>I moved to Utah yesterday for the summer, because of my internship with Qualtrics. I'm excited to see what the place has in store for me as the summer progresses but so far it looks like an interesting place. We ended up reserving an Airbnb near downtown Provo that turned out to be pretty nice. In fact, it's quite better than my apartment in Ann Arbor, and is furnished which is a big benefit, especially in a place where you don't know anyone.</p>
<p>I arrived around the afternoon yesterday, the first of my roommates. I'm about 4 days early before beginning work on Monday. However arriving early is nice because I'll have a few days to get up to speed with things here. The thing I enjoy most about Provo so far is the scenery. The mountains still have snow caps even though it's close to summertime, and just tower in the background of the landscape. They're incredibly beautiful, especially to traveller coming from the very flat state of Michigan.</p>
<p>I found an amazing Mexican restaurant called <a href="http://www.elgallogiroutah.com/">El Gallo Giro</a>, where I had some awesome fish tacos. I also explored much of downtown Provo. The street naming system here is a fairly interesting and logical one. The crossroads of Center St. and University Ave is the "origin" point of the city, or the heart of Provo. Center St. runs East and West, so every street south of Center is 100 S, 200 S, etc. while every street north of Center is 100 N, 200 N, etc. It follows that University runs North and South, and every street West and East are number similarly. Perhaps it's a common city planning technique, but it's fairly logical and it allows you visualize locations much better without the use of a Map or having to memorize a bunch of random street names. It's much different from Detriot where downtown is the center and everything expands out from the center in a semi-circle like a spider web.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see what live is going to be like here. It may be that it could fit my living style but I'm skeptical. It's a bit remote. Perhaps I would be happier closer to downtown Salt Lake City, but I think staying here for a while and living a few months in the Provo way might give me a better idea to say for sure.</p>
