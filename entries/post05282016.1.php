<p>I recently received an Apple Watch from my cousin for my 21st birthday. As a "techie" I have to say i'm quite fascinated with the device. It's so small but it does quite a bit. The integration with the Apple iPhone just makes at an interesting and well designed product to use, really smoothing out the experience between the phone and the watch. It satisfies the 2 biggest usecases of my phone - the time and the weather. It also satisfies a couple other big ones - like keeping track of my notifications, reminding me of events on my calendar, and provides a great interface for timekeeping like alarms and timers.</p>
<p>When they say that the apple watch helps you do a lot of small tasks on your phone without directly interfacing with it by pulling it out of your pocket, they're spot on. I've noticed that number of times that I take my phone out of my pocket or even carry my phone around with me has gone down quite a bit. Now, I don't feel like I need to keep my phone on my person or in front of my face where I can access it in order to stay available and notified of important things. Especially since I've now deleted the Facebook app from my phone, I end up having much fewer notifications. Coupled with my Apple watch, which lets me quickly see - and most of the time promptly dismiss - my notification infatuation has greatly decreased. This has lead, most noticeably, to reduced screen time. I find myself looking at screens much less now. Especially when I had Facebook installed on my phone, and the constant need to keep the phone on me, it was so easy to return, time after time, to my phone screen and spend hours in the day mindlessly scrolling through a newsfeed of information that wasn't substantial or even that entertaining.</p>
<p>Less time on my phone has translated to better focus and attentiveness to my environment. I'm not constantly "plugged in", and I can choose to concentrate much more on the physical world around me. In many ways, by adding an additional screen to the collection I already carry around, I've actually been able to claim back some independence from those same screens.</p>
<p>The Apple watch has even created a usecase that I didn't even know I had, and that's the drive to be more physically active everyday. The Apple Watch contains this Activity app, which tracks my physical activity throughout the day. It measures a couple vitals like heart rate, and couples that with movement from the attached phone and your body measurements to track the number calories burnt everyday, including a breakdown of resting calories versus active movement calories. It also measures exercise time and standing time, or the number of hours each day for which you stand and move around for a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>I usually have a on and off relationship with fitness. I try to stay healthy and active by eating foods that are better for me, and try for a while to maintain a steady, but slightly rigorous fitness routine. Then eventually life happens and I get busy or involved with something until I start to make excuses for myself for why it's inconvenient for me to work out that day or how I'm just too tired and don't have the time. Eventually after skipping a few times, I get comfortable with idea of skipping and I end up rationalizing away the need to be active. Instead I re-double my efforts in making dietary changes to "make up" for my lacking physical activity which also ends up being difficult to maintain for very long before I decide that I want to break my own rules a few times. Of course, that routine also eventually degrades until I find divine intervention in a mirror a few months later and decide to repeat the cycle over</p>
<p>I'm sure my habits aren't all too different from that of young professionals like me who stay busy and try to pursue multiple interests. As a young generation born with rise of the internet and technology at our fingertips, people like me have become accustomed to super fast everything. We look for instant returns, instant growth and instant results. We're from the age of Google, where the answer to almost any factual question is only a few keystrokes away. Unfortunately, our bodies can't keep up with evolution of silicon. Health, fitness, and lifestyles are things that, for the foreseeable future, are only built with love, care, dedication and <b>time</b>. That's why I think that when people don't see results from exercising, but are quick to feel the loss in time and energy, they treat the overall experience as a loss. Eating healthy with more home-cooked meals and fresh vegetables requires more effort and more time, often not resulting in an equivalent return, making eating healthy yet another chore.</p>
<p>For me, The Apple Watch satiates some of that impatience by providing me with the statistics of the Activity app. I get to see how I'm doing as far as physical activity each day. It gives me insights into my health that I haven't had before, and that would require much more time and expensive equipment to measure. It also has these activity goals that I can benchmark myself against. In a way, I'm competing against myself to live a more active lifestyle everyday, and I can be consistently tuned into my progress. In this way, the Apple watch has transformed me from being obsessed over a newsfeed to becoming obsessed over a healthier lifestyle.
