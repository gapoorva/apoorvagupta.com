<p>Recently, I was in a situation with a stranger after which I left feeling really mad. I wouldn't say I was upset, because the feeling wasn't really of feeling put-off or "inconvenience". I felt truely and strangely angry. I say strangely because I don't get mad quite often. I consider myself a patient and forgiving individual. I'm occasionally stubborn, but I do attempt to keep a strong moral compass and evaluate what my role was in the situation, how I possibly may be part of the problem and if I should be upset. But this time all the usual rationality took a backseat to instinctive, uncontrolled rage. As I was writing this, I realized my ranting was not as brief as I intended, so sectioned it off.</p>
<p><b> The Situation </b></p>
<p>I suppose I'm not completely at peace with the situation either, so I'll briefly recount what happened. My grandparents on my mother's side are staying at my parent's home for the summer. My grandfather is a religous man, and so he fasts every Tuesday. They are from India, and back at home he usually goes to the temple in the evening on Tuesdays to pray and break his fast. On his first Tuesday in the US, my mother suggested taking him to our local temple. There was a service that was scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM. We left at 6:55, and knowing we were late, I sped a little bit in the residential (nieghborhood) area. Yes, I know this is wrong, traffic laws and stuff, but keep reading.</p>
<p>As we were going down a road in the neighborhood, a resident flagged us down and made us stop. He came up to the window, put his hands on the car and said, "Slow down. You can't go that fast here blah blah I'm on the board, I'll call the police on you blah blah do you understand?". Knowing I'm in the wrong, but also getting even more late because of this guy, I solemnly answer "I understand". Then he says "You understand what?". And for whatever reason that made me lose it. I grit my teeth, but <b>respectfully</b> answered back. Then he went on to lecture me for a few minutes, the whole time talking like I was pre-teen driver.</p>
<p>While some of the initial anger was due to the shot at my pride, the anger still lingers now, a couple days after the event. When I returned from the temple, I sat aside to think about why I felt so angry. I wasn't sure whether it was completely a young-blood, injured-pride anger or something else. Now, I think it wasn't that the man had pointed out my mistake, but rather the <i>way</i> he'd pointed it out. It's like he thought that I was trouble child, a juvenile. It's that he thought I was a child and not an adult worthy of the same respect he'd give another neighbor. He was on the board? That didn't vest authority in him to speak to me like that. Threatening to call the police on a niegbhor for driving 5 above the limit? I'm not sure if it's common opinion, but I feel that to theathen to call the police on another man seems to be quite to measure, one that you take when you see a known criminal. I acknowledge that I had made a mistake, and perhaps it would take the comment of complete stranger for me to actually internalize it, but I still believe such comments should be given with respect. That man was not my father, and he should not have spoken to me like I was his ill-tempered, irresponsible son.</p>
<p>/rant?</p>
<p><b>The Afterthought</b></p>
<p>After I'd stopped fuming at what happened, I thought it might be interesting to write about getting mad. Why do we get mad? What happens in our brains, on a neurological level? What makes us un-mad? Right now, I'm on the plane heading to Salt Lake City, Utah, so I'm not gonna be able to do a bunch of research on the neurological side of things but I can talk about my opinion on the philosophy.</p>
<p>I think we get mad as part of a fight or flight response to stimuli from our environment. I think people are lot more likely to act irrationally or aggressively when they are confronted by a stranger or someone they think is malicous, perhaps dangerous. On the biological level I think that's what happens. But almost everything about our biology, our compositon and natural functions are product of evolution. Everything that we do and are is somehow a product of millenia of trial and error. That means somewhere along the line, being mad is part of our genetic code. It's part of what makes us human simply because the only reason we still get mad is that it helps us survive. </p>
<p>This begs the question...What is it about getting mad that helps us survive? When I think about getting mad, I immediately start considering the consequences of me being mad. I instinctually feel that being mad results in my saying things and acting in a way that could be hurtful for the people around me, possibly eroding relationships that I intend on preserving. It could result in the destruction of my or someone else's property. It could result in self-inflicting pain and suffering. Generally, and most importantly, getting mad impairs our rationality that we'd otherwise maintain when we're just normal. When rationality is impaired, we end up doing things like I mentioned above that ruins relationships or just hurts us in the long run. For example, after my car stopping incedent, I was distracted and silently angry, spoiling the trip to the temple for my grandfather which was the whole point in the first place.</p>
<p>If being mad impairs our rationality, and therefore impairs our actions from possibly acting self-destructively, and ultimately reduces our chances of survival, why is it that getting mad is still a human characteristic? Why hasn't evolution killed off all the mad people? Being mad sometimes has it's advantages. When you get mad, you often let go of rationality sometimes, and this essentially reduces how much you think about something, and ultimately it helps you not be as afraid. When you're not as afraid, you tend to intimidate more than be intimidated. Getting mad helps you be vicious and shows potential sources of danger that you are a force to be dealt with. I can see this being a key survival component.</p>
<p>I think being mad also forces you to think and care about something. If you get mad over a situation, it's inherent that what happened invoked a response in you because it concerned something that you care about. This makes sense because after the car incedent, I still keep thinking about why I'm mad, and the situation, and what happened. I care about both mistake but also how I was treated. I care about my self-respect and the respect that others show me. I care about my repuation in society and being a good citizen. Getting mad over that situation is evidence that I'm invested in some moral principles, for which I'm ready to take a stand for. Getting mad from time to time, reafirms our beliefs and principles, and makes us revisit what we value. In fact, I think it's important to get mad because if one never got mad, it means that no situation carries enough gravity to matter to that person. That person simply doesn't care. And indifference to what happens to you doesn't lead to survival.</p>
<p>So I think we get mad because we care. It makes sense, because it would explain why my parents get mad at me for doing something wrong, why citizens get mad at governments for oppression, and even why that man may have been mad at me for speeding. It's clear that he cared about something too.</p>
<p>Anger seems to be an interesting and rather lengthy topic, so I'll probably write a second entry about it. Maybe we can explore the literature on neurological explainations for anger.</p>
