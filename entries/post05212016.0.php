<p>This is day two of living and hanging out with my new Provo roommates Josh Sherick and Berwin Xie. I hung out with Josh the first day he was here, and Berwin arrived later that same day. I like them both, they're very friendly and we have similar temperaments and interests.</p>
<p>When Josh arrived, we first went to Starbucks where we bought some coffee (in the land of Mormons) and exchanged stories about Michigan, CAEN, California internships and our impressions of Qualtrics. We then went shopping for groceries at Walmart and Costco, where we ended up sharing a lot of the food that we bought.</p>
<p>Berwin arrived later that night and we all hung out, played some Mario Kart. I made a pizza dinner for everyone. We ate together and they did most of the cleaning, it was a very family like thing, which I was pleasantly surprised about. I got introduced to the show Silicon Valley which is really hilarious, I can see us quoting the show all summer.</p>
<p>This next day, we took Berwin shopping since he missed the last trip. Then we hiked to the Y, supposedly the most popular hike here in Provo.</p>
<p>This time, the unity among roommates is a lot better than both my California experiences and even at University of Michigan. I'd consider my Michigan roommates to be my best friends, but even so we never sit down and have dinner together. I think there's a couple factors to this but it's probably mostly the homogeneity between us. At school, the roommates and I have different schedules that cause us to lead relatively independent lives. It was a similar story in California, where my roommates worked in different departments than I did, were of legal age, and were simply interested in different things. These Utah roommates seem to be much more similar to me and perhaps that's why we're getting along so well.</p>
<p>How do you get unity among a family then? A typical 4 person family often consists of very different people who are typically at very different point of their life. How do you achieve similar unity here? I think part of the reason needs to also come from compromise and co-dependance. A functional family (or any group) functions quite like a unit. Even as humans need social interaction and company, working as part of a unit benefits the group as a whole. Every member contributes something to make it work.</p>
<p>And whatever the social science is behind it, finding good people to be with in a place you don't know anyone is undoubtedly a rare thing, so I hope this feel continues throughout the summer.</p>
